# HW01-CodeRefactor

This is Homework 1 of the UC DAVIS Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment we were to go into the HTML and CSS and increase the web accessibility of the site. In the HTML file I fixed the fisrt link anchor so that it went to the desired location on the page, I converted three of the divs into sections(Header, Main, anf Footer) for better organization, then I added comments to explain where you are in the html. In the CSS I condensed many of the ID's that had the same styling.
